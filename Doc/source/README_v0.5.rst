==========================

Introduction
============

This release (v0.5) is intended to provide interested users with an idea of the data quality and format of the 3D-HST WFC3/G141 grism products.  Full catalogs of the spectra, photometry, and products derived from these (redshifts, stellar-population properties, etc.) are still under development and are expected to be released by Fall 2012.  This README provides information on the specific products released here.  For more general information on the survey, see the summary paper: 

    `"3D-HST: A Wide-field Grism Spectroscopic Survey with the Hubble Space Telescope"`, Brammer et al., 2012, ApJS-submitted (`arXiv:xxx <http://www.arXiv.org | arXiv>`_)
